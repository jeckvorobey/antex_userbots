## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Group orchestrator reuse
The system SHALL reuse per-group scheduled orchestrators across scheduler ticks while the group's effective runtime signature is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Unchanged group reuses orchestrator
- **WHEN** two scheduler ticks run for the same enabled group without settings or resolved target changes
- **THEN** the second tick reuses the existing `SwarmOrchestrator` instance for that group

#### Scenario: Changed group rebuilds orchestrator
- **WHEN** a group's effective schedule, target, city, max turns, or skip-human-activity setting changes
- **THEN** the next scheduler tick creates a replacement `SwarmOrchestrator` for that group

#### Scenario: Disabled group cache is pruned
- **WHEN** a reload removes or disables a group
- **THEN** the scheduler cache removes that group's orchestrator and stops ticking it
